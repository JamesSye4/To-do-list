# To-do-list
Paired Programming day 1
<!-- Created To Do List that can view, add, complete, delete, count, and archive tasks -->

<!-- Users can add tasks by inputing text into the textbox labeled 'Add Task' after inputting their task (ie; Brush teeth), users can click the Add button. Once a task or tasks are made they can be completed, deleted, or edited by the user. Completed tasks will be moved into the archive section where they can then be deleted or edited further. -->
